title: Dentist, not so numb as it sounds

The deep pits and crevases of my molars finally got the upper hand in the battle between good enamel and not so good enamel: cavities (Isn't it funny we name a hole in your tooth a different name for a hole?)

At my appointment time, I show up, sit in the recliner, and get asked: "Do you want to be numbed?"

"Waaat?"

Essentially, the cavity was only in the enamel and not near the nerve, meaning no numbing. Yea!

But! It's kinda weird having the dentist grind away with his precision drill...AND FEEL NO PAIN!

Plus, epoxy for the win.
