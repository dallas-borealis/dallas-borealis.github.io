# The Red Fox Puppet

<p class="subtitle">11 Aug 2021 - Kingston</p>

To look at it now, the red fox puppet has matted red fur, a missing black felt eye, and browny aged white...things. And smells of oldness, like something that was damp then dry several times over. The box it came from, it's home for the past five years, has fared better but it too has mustiness from the wet Pacific Northwest winters and the hotness of summer crawlspace storage.

This is the first I've set eyes on the puppet since I got it and put in the box. A 'gift' from my mom as she was opening old boxes from moving just a couple miles away to several thousand and over 30 years previous. These cardboard timecapsules sprout not only spores but emotions. For my mom, those emotions are more a relief as she gets to get rid of something while at the same time letting me enjoy this happy relic.

And like the relics from an Indiana Jones movie, this one sets off a series emotional dominoes that go back to a few days in early September 1976.

Rose Hill Elementary; beginning of the school year; brand new student in first grade.

I can picture a [large oak tree](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.6760298,-122.1682525,3a,75y,345.22h,82.96t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUR3LDcZcjNp6GkBl-_lOSA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), its leaves still green but just beginning to loose some; that unique nutty smell from the hot day and cool, dewy nights. It's morning recess and kids are yelling while climbing on polished steel monkey bars that even the smallest kid could shake with ease. Wood chips, maybe bark -- the memory is dim -- for safety (pfft. You knew not to fall).

Me? I stood under the oak tree. And cried.

I knew no one. Had no idea how to get to know anyone. So, I stood there and cried. A playground assistant -- Ms. Snyder? -- came over with words of encouragement but soon turned to 'buck-up buttercup' ad hominems that got me to charge right on the field and introduce myself.

Lunch was the same: sit by myself and eat my lunch in silence.

It was a few days after this wash-rinse-repeat cycle of being alone and crying that someone -- my dad, maybe -- put the red fox puppet in my lunchbox. The red, plaid metal lunchbox with a white, macreme handle stuffed with a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich. And a red fox puppet. How that thing made me feel better, I have no idea. All I know is that 45 years later, I could feel that pit of anxiety and anxiousness that I felt on the playground of Rose Hill Elementary  and then immediately feel the relief when I looked at my friend.

And I can't throw away my friend. I got choked up telling my wife about the fox, and how disrespectful it would be chuck this thing into the garbage. It deserves a burial, a wake, something more than a careless discarding. So, in the greatest sense of irony, it went back in the box.
