I have toyed with the idea of starting a blog a few times: 1) I'm gonna be a writer; 2) I'm gonna be a writer (a few years later); 3) I need to find a place to save my scratch files (another story); 4) holy crap, themes in blogger, wordpress, tumblr, etc. are a pain...blah blah blah

But I'm serious this time. 

After ditching my scratch file, I still needed a place to capture those things that draw my attention, I want to save for later (or never), but also share. And I think this platform may be the perfect tool for doing that: easy, free, and ubiquitous.

That said, here's the vision: almost every day, something draws my attention or elicits an emotional response. Gather these noticings or responses, and share.

And on that note, I wish myself take luck, good care.
