Following a couple personality assessments (Hogan assessment, DiSC, etc.) I like to talk to think. This may not be a 'good thing.' In fact, it's not a good thing. Especially in the role I have: manager. As a manager, I talk with other managers. I also talk to directors, vice-presidents, and even c-levels. These are not people who appreciate someone talking through their thinking.  

And neither does my wife.

Which got me thinking: can I write to think? It will be a new approach; requires practice; and the results are unpredictable. The key is to get the subject of the thinking down somewhere before it's forgotten (because the great part about talking is you don't need anything other than air).

So, here's the plan: 
1) Always have a means of taking a note (pencil, paper, phone, tablet, etc.).
2) Spend a set amount of time each day to write/think (although I'm inclined to think the writing will take as much time as needed).
3) Save conclusions in a clear and concise summary. Somewhere.
