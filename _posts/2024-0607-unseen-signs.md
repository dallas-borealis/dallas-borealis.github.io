Today would have been my mom's 83rd birthday. She passed a year ago on 30 May 2023 after being admitted to the hospital on Mother's Day. It appeared she would be back to her home with my dad in a couple weeks. Within that two weeks something happened. Likely another stroke.

I visited her on Sunday. She acknwoledged me. She seemed tired. 

Monday, I got a call; moved her to hospice. Wednesday, the 30th, I watched her breathe her last breath.

On the 30th this year my brother texted me, asking how I was doing? "Okay, I guess," I wrote back. He said he's been grumpy for the last couple weeks. I said the same, ever since Mother's Day. He agreed that's when it started for him.

I told him I had dream about Mom but didn't go into the details because, texts.

Here's my dream:  
My mom is sitting/leaning on a bar stool in some VRBO/AirBnB house on a family vaction. Her arms are crossed and she has this snit look on her face. The she says to me: "Why didn' you have a parade for me?" I'm shocked to hear her voice as she wasn't able to speak because of a stroke. And then, and this is what really hit, I realize she's dead and she's come back to say this to me.

Grief. It's a weird thing...
