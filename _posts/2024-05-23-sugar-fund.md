This post is driven by funky backbeats: [_"(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeeOPR8bxac) by Fatback Band. However, my introduction to this song was through ["_Like Sugar_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RecY5iZn6B0&t=237s) by Chaka Khan which has the wickedest bass groove, which I thought had to come from somewhere (I hate to think that but there is so much good music that's sampled) and sure enough that's where Fatback Band comes in. _"(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop_" was the song sampled to provide the rhythm. But there's another version that extends the 1970's orginal to the 2018 hit: ["_(Are you Ready) Do the Bus Stop / Suga_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmIEaoeAA1Q) a remix/mash up from the soundtrack album for Netflix series "The Get Down" but I can't find anything for "Sugar". Still, all three are bangers.
