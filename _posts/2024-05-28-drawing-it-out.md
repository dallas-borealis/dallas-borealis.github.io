For the last 20+ years I've struggled to draw. A once successful technical illustrator...oh, who'm I kidding: I drew simple illustrations of wires inside airplanes (and a few pieces of equipment) for about five years. But until leaving the illustration group I could always count on having some 'recreational' piece of drawing underway. 

And then I didn't.

The sketchbooks I have started and partially filled are an archive of my _desire_ to draw and the struggle to actually draw. So what's getting in the way? Twenty plus years of contemplation have given me this: I'm scared.

I'm scared to try. I'm scared to practice. I'm scared to fail. I'm scared to not meet my expectations. I'm scared that I like the _idea_ of drawing but not the doing. I'm scared I lost my fearlessness of my youth. I'm scared I'm too old.

I'm scared that I've lost my ability to feel, emotionally feel, anything anymore.

I'm scared I'm numb to the world.

Just saying that actually feels good. Cathartic, I suppose. And perhaps that's all that's needed to try again. Fail again. Practice again. Reset expectations, again.
